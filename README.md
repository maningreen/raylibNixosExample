# raylib nixos example

i recently swapped from arch linux to nixos, and i wanna get back into raylib with that change

to keep doing raylib i needed to set up a new environment, so i have, and here it is, feel free to clone it to start any projects of yours, or any improvements to it.

# how to use

`nix develop`
will put you into a shell with the flake (ensure you have flakes enabled)
from here you will be able to do shtuff

my recomendation is to edit the makefile to your liking, good luck and happy coding!
